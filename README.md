# advent-of-code-2023

Going through the Advent of code 2023 using Java 21. Should be a fun ride. Also I have a blog if you want you
can [check it out here](https://www.codingnagger.com/) or ping me
on [Minds @CodingNagger](https://minds.com/CodingNagger).

## Blog posts

Over the past couple of years I ran a cruise log but this year I decided to take a more relaxed approach.
I'm easing myself both into [blogging and the Advent of Code](https://www.codingnagger.com/tag/advent-of-code-2023/)
with fewer entries but as much fun.
